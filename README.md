How to Classify Photos of Dogs and Cats (with 97% accuracy)
Dogs vs. Cats Prediction Problem
The dogs vs cats dataset refers to a dataset used for a Kaggle machine learning competition held in 2013.

The dataset is comprised of photos of dogs and cats provided as a subset of photos from a much larger dataset of 3 million manually annotated photos. The dataset was developed as a partnership between Petfinder.com and Microsoft.

In this , we can developed a baseline convolutional neural network model for the dogs vs. cats dataset.

A baseline model will establish a minimum model performance to which all of our other models can be compared, as well as a model architecture that we can use as the basis of study and improvement.

A good starting point is the general architectural principles of the VGG models.
Later on we made some modifications and used VGG-16 model to reach 97% accuracy
